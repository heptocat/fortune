# fortune
I love having [FORTUNE(6)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=fortune&sektion=6&manpath=FreeBSD+6.4-RELEASE) run on my login-shell and configuring cookies myself. I cannot find a non-personal collection of topic-specific fortune cookies. So here it is.

A script to add the as well as a custom collection file to run after download shall be added soon.

# contributing
The point of this repo is for people to contribute. Add fitting quotes to a file of your choosing or create an own. Add source when fitting. Fortune is meant to print "a random, hopefully interesting, adage" - (adage := a proverb or short statement expressing a general truth.)

* *Let's keep the quality*: Only add quotes / other adages that you personally like, find inspiring or funny.
* All topics should have an own file named [directory]-topic. Please don't include "-" in the file name otherwise

Let's see what abstruse subtopics the internet will find.
Quotes are separated by %.
See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Fortune#Creating_custom_files

# Topics
collection of fortune cookies to any imaginable topic, sorted in directories. Every directory has a [directory]-all. This is not meant to collect all subtopics, but as a file for all things that do not fit in a subtopic
