“When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. 
Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! 
I don't want your D*** lemons, what the h*** am I supposed to do with these? 
Demand to see life's manager! 
Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! 
Do you know who I am? 
I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! 
I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!”
― J.K. Simmons
